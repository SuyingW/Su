        <h1>Hey, I’m <span>Suying</span> :) </h1>

        <p>I’m a 3rd year student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, BC. 
            With my initial intention to major in neuroscience/biomed/physiology upon entering university, 
            I never expected myself to do anything involving coding until I took my first computer science course and data science courses. 
            The challenges and opportunities captivated me so much that I decided to pivot my academic path, 
            ultimately leading me to pursue a major in <span>Statistics</span> and a minor in <span>Data Science</span>. In the past two years, 
            I got to create some <a href="projects.html">cool projects</a> with my friends and classmates, and now I’m so thrilled to craft this personal website.</p>
            
        <p>Currently, I’m learning a lot about database, machine learning, computer system, and full-stack development. 
            I'm back in school, hoping to pass all my courses and land my <span>first co-op job placement</span>.</p>
            
        <p>Outside of school, I’m a passionate language learner and I love language exchane. I'm working on <a href="work.html">Cantonese</a> for my part-time job and Japanese as I played karate for a solid 6 years. </p>
        
        <div class="last">
            <p>If you are interested in my work and projects, or if we share any similar interests - 
                Don’t hesitate to connect with me, <span>I’d love to chat</span>!
