                My Part-time Job as a <a>Sales Rep</a> at Telus
            </h1>
            <h2>Why I started this job</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a huge fan of Cantonese drama. 
                <a>Cantonese is such a beautiful language</a> and I love it. 
                So, I thought, why not find a job in Richmond so I can immerse myself in Cantonese all the time? 
                During the interview, the manager asked me if I was fluent in Cantonese. 
                I didn’t speak a single word of Cantonese at that time, but still managed to pass the interview. 
            </p>
            <h2>How’s the training process</h2>
            <p>
                The first few days working there I had no idea how to talk to customers at all. 
                Actually, I never expected someone as introverted as myself would end up in a role that involves such <a>extensive customer interaction</a>. 
                The training process involved a significant amount of learning, memorization, and developing soft skills, which really helped me improve as a more flexible and professional staff. 
                After 2 months of intense practice, I finally successfully completed my probationary period and became a permanent part-time sales rep. 
                I really appreciate my supervisors and colleagues who always encourage me, practice the art of conversation/sales strategies with me and teach me Cantonese!!!                
            </p>
            <h2>My Amazing Colleagues</h2>
            <p>
            I met some <a>interesting</a> people over the course of this half a year. 
            The sweetest Canto girl who studies Chinese medicine and always teaches me Cantonese sentence by sentence. 
            The supervisor who speaks 5 languages and is too hard-working that she will “work herself to death”. 
            The guy who calls himself a future data analyst and always role-plays with me to help me learn Cantonese. 
            The rich guy who rents two rooms, one for himself and one for his dogs. 
            The lady that nobody understands when she speaks in Teochew, and the girl who’s so determined to get into UBC…
            </p>
            <h2>My Cantonese is getting a lot better!</h2> 
            <p>
            Learning Cantonese is the most <a>enjoyable yet challenging</a> part of my work. 
            Considering my proficiency as a native Mandarin speaker, initially I thought Cantonese shouldn’t be difficult for me at all.
            The scripts and word order are similar, it’s just that the pronunciations are different, 
            so it should be quick to adapt to Cantonese sounds.
            Soon it became evident that my assumptions are so incorrect, 
            I shouldn’t undermine the time and effort it takes to master a new language. 
            Talking to real people is not like watching TVB, I could not understand anything without subtitles, 
            especially when customers talk fast in a non Canto/HongKong accent. 
            It took me more than 2 months to start talking in Cantonese, 
            though the customers are always like “it’s okay we speak English and Mandarin” after hearing my first sentence. 
            Surprisingly, the greatest obstacle on my journey of learning Cantonese is that everyone speaks good English or Mandarin. 
            When they hear my broken Cantonese, they opt for a language that we are both fluent in. 
            That’s when I decided to <a>put more effort outside my working hours</a>. 
            I watched every Youtube tutorial and Spotify podcast that I could find. 
            I think in Cantonese, talk in Cantonese, and write in Cantonese till I can carry a full Cantonese conversation. 
            </p>
            <h1> Despite Cantonese, the job did teach me something else:</h1>
            <h3>A collaborative and supportive working environment is essential for personal and professional growth.</h3>
            <p>
                 My colleagues are the best colleagues. 
                 They gave me opportunities and encouraged me to take on more responsibilities to <a>build confidence</a>. 
                 When confronting tough customers, they were always there to hold my back. 
                 My effort is valued when working with them and I feel <a>safe</a> to ask for help or guidance.
            </p>
            <h3>Not to take criticism personally.</h3>
            <p>
                 Customer service is stressful. 
                 There are always customers who give me a hard time by pushing me to do what I’m not allowed to do or accusing me for what I didn’t do.
                  When I don’t think their criticism is just, I <a>respect</a> their courage to say it out loud to my face and <a>move on</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Appreciate my education.</h3>
            <p>
                 Upon working here I realized that not everyone has the opportunity to receive higher education and gain the skills that would <a>lead them to a more enhanced career</a>. 
                 This makes me appreciate my university education which allows me to get access to resources, gain technical skills, and expand my network.
            </p>
            <p>
                唔知点解嚟咗加拿大之后好钟意睇TVB，譬如话金庸嘅武侠小说改编嘅电视剧同埋时装剧，睇咗几部之后发觉<a>白话係一种非常非常之靓嘅语言</a>，
                就谂住不如喺Richmond揾份工先，咁样就可以成日听白话了喎！
                面试Manager问我识唔识讲广东话，唔知嗰阵时边度嚟嘅信心，竟然话“听得明，你而家同我讲都冇问题”🤣，
                但其实只不过听得明少少简单嘅，复杂嘅一个字都唔识听，不过好彩面试仲顺利通过咗！
            </p>
            <p>
                因为係第一次出嚟做嘢有啲紧张，啱啱开始嗰阵时完全不识点样同客人sale，
                头两个月嘅training好唔容易，笔记写咗成本书都唔一定记得住，第二个礼拜翻工先发觉“弊啦，又唔记得咗”！
                之后每日不断地讲不断地练习，到而家终于好熟（虽然仲有讲错价钱嘅时候😖）。
            </p>
            <p>
                由三月到而家已经做嘢半年啦，<a>识到咗好多好好嘅同埋有趣嘅同事</a>：
                针灸师C一句一句写低教我讲广东话；识讲5种语言嘅卷王X成日落单超Target两倍；
                未来嘅数据分析师J写咗好多Project放喺GitHub入边；P好钟意好钟意狗仔租两间屋俾一间狗仔同埋要同狗仔训同间屋；
                E励志要去读UBC；M日日翻工划水仲可以攞到Promotion；Q讲起潮汕话好似讲天书咁。
                <a>我谂如果唔係喺呢度做嘢，我呢世都唔会有机会识到佢哋！虽然佢哋睇唔到但都好想同佢哋话好多好多声多谢嗮！</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a>呢半年见识咗各种各样嘅客</a>，有啲客好礼貌，但亦都有多次同啲好窜嘅客正面交锋，
                俾人哋闹（老实讲中学俾老师闹惯咗冇咩感觉🤪），
                仲有客以为我唔识讲广东话话我係痴线（好想同佢哋话其实我识嘅）！
                最好笑係嫐到块面都红嗮嘅客入来话佢月费冇端端变成咗千蚊个月，睇完细节先发觉其实係佢屋企人偷偷瞒住佢签咗部手机🥲。
            </p>
            <p>
                头几个月每次有客嚟话“广东话得不得”或者“我想问吓…”我都冇自信话“得”，
                只识讲最简单嘅“卅九蚊廿G”，讲住讲住就讲翻普通话。
                但呢个月终于用广东话落咗一单🎉🎉。
                <a>而家终于可以好大声地自信地讲出嚟</a>，除咗有一次嚟咗个客都唔係母语者，我哋两互相听唔明对方嘅普通话口音同客家口音，
                真係冇办法沟通得到，睇嚟仲需要继续讲多啲练多啲！
                以前喺内地读中学嗰阵最唔钟意就係中文堂，完全冇谂过而家成日听成日学中文，好似呢世都冇过咁高嘅水平🤣。
            </p>
            <div class="last">
                <p>
                    仲有啊，我谂以后冇论我喺边度广东话都一定会继续讲落去，<a>真係好钟意好钟意广东话</a>🔥
